The focus of these projects was numerical linear algebra - solving linear systems numerically and efficiently.

If mistakes are found, please dont hesitate to suggest amendments! 

## Matlab_exercises
These exercises helped me learn the necessary basic tools in order to use matlab effectively for more complicated tasks. My original score was 95%, but I have made the appropiate amendments.

## Givens-QR Factorisation
The following code is of a function that computes the Givens-QR factorisation of a general square upper Hessenberg matrix. A Hessenberg matrix is an upper triangular matrix with an additional first subdiagonal. My mark for this task was 100%.

## LU Factorisation with partial pivoting
This file contains a function that solves a linear system via LU factorisation with partial pivoting in order to achieve better numerical stability. I achieved a score of 80% and have made necessary changes.

## Polynomial Preconditioing of Gradient Descent Method
This file contains a function that implements the Steepest Descent method with polynomial preconditioning based on Richardson splitting to solve the linear system Ax = b. My mark was 100%
